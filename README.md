## Project Overview

**BharatLink** is a digital ecosystem designed to **bridge the gap between rural skills and urban opportunities**.  
It empowers rural artisans, craftsmen, and workers by connecting them directly with industries, startups, and individuals in urban areas — transforming traditional skills into sustainable income sources.  

Our platform enables:
- Local **skill discovery** and **digital onboarding** in regional languages.  
- **AI-based skill-to-work matchmaking** using a structured recommendation model.  
- A **voice-enabled interface** for users with limited literacy.  
- **Trust score** and community validation system.  
- Promotion of regional identities — like **Karnataka’s handloom**, **Rajasthan’s crafts**, and **Bihar’s Madhubani art** — to preserve culture while creating livelihood.

##  Problem Statement

Millions of rural workers in India possess unique, high-value skills — but lack visibility, access to digital job markets, or means to showcase their expertise.  
Existing job platforms focus on urban users, leaving rural artisans digitally excluded.  

**BharatLink** aims to solve this by creating a **Rural Skill Network** that:
1. Digitizes skill data via voice or text input.  
2. Uses AI to categorize and match skills to suitable opportunities.  
3. Connects employers with verified rural talent directly.
